<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genetic Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The genetic vaccine market primarily includes two types: recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines involve the insertion of DNA sequences into host cells, prompting them to produce specific proteins, which stimulate an immune response without using live pathogens. Gene-based vaccines, on the other hand, utilize genetic materials such as DNA or RNA to instruct cells to produce antigens, provoking an immune reaction. Both types are promising for their ability to provide targeted, effective immunization against various diseases.</p></p>

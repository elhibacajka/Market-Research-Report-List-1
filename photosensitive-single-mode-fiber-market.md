<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li><li>Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photosensitive single mode fiber market is primarily divided into two types: cladding photosensitive single mode fiber and unclad photosensitive single mode fiber. Cladding photosensitive fibers have a photosensitive core surrounded by a protective cladding, enhancing signal performance and minimizing loss. In contrast, unclad photosensitive fibers lack this protective layer, resulting in different light propagation characteristics, often used for applications requiring high sensitivity to external light variations. Both types serve specialized roles in telecommunications and sensing applications, catering to diverse technical needs.</p></p>

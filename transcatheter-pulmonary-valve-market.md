<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expanded</li><li>Self-Expanded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve market consists of two primary types: balloon-expanded and self-expanded valves. Balloon-expanded valves are deployed using a balloon that expands the valve to fit securely within the existing structure, providing immediate stability. In contrast, self-expanded valves utilize a material that allows them to expand automatically upon deployment, adapting to the anatomy of the patient. Both types are designed for minimally invasive procedures, offering effective treatment options for patients with pulmonary valve dysfunction.</p></p>
